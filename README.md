# ReverseWordsInLine

## Overview

`ReverseWordsInLine` is a Java program that reads lines of text from an input file, reverses the order of words in each line while preserving the characters order within each word, and then writes the reversed lines to an output file.

### Technologies Used
```Java Development Kit (JDK) version 21```

## Features

- Reads input from a specified text file (`input.txt` by default).
- Reverses the order of words in each line.
- Handles different cases including special characters.
- Writes the reversed lines to an output file (`output.txt` by default).

## Usage

1. **Input File:** Ensure the input file (`input.txt`) exists and contains the lines of text you want to reverse.

2. **Output File:** The reversed lines will be written to `output.txt`. Make sure the output directory (`D:/Assesment No.1/Task1/files/` in this case) exists and is writable.

3. **Running the Program:**
   - Ensure you have ```Java Development Kit (JDK) version 21``` installed on your machine.
   - Compile the `ReverseWordsInLine.java` file.
   - Run the compiled class (`ReverseWordsInLine`) with Java.

   Example command-line usage:
